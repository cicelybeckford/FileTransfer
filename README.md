# Simple File Transfer System
- [x] Implement the installation of Linux OS and Openthread, and setting up the mesh network on Raspberry Pi
- [x] Implement a server and client file transfer application on each device using IPv6  connection. Once connected to the client using telnet, a user should be able to specify the file path of the document being requested from the server. The server on receiving this request should return the file requested by the client. If this file is not found, an appropriate error message should be displayed.
- [x] Implement a functionality to display the round trip time of each file request. 
- [x] **Extra Credit:** Create an encryption mechanism between data transfers using AES Symmetric key encryption. That is, data sent is encrypted at the senderâ€™s side and decrypted at the receiver's side using a single key.
